## NVIM Tutor

Below I report some useful commands that you can find in Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 of the nvim tutorial. To access those chapters you just have to type the command `:Tutor`. The file that will be opened is the Chapter 1, to access Chapter 2 you need to open the link at the end of the file.

Chapters are divided in Lessons, and at the end of each one you can find a summary. I will copy and paste the summary and remove the commands that I already know.
