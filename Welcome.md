**Why I created a Void in Obsidian?**
I created this void mainly because i needed a place in which i could write simple and fast notes. About what? About anything.

Usually i rewrite the notes that i take during lesson at my university
in latex. But i needed a place in which i could write less detailed
notes and also i want to organize topics in small files.

I tried to use Notion but the problem was that it has too much things
that i don't need. I don't want to create an account, I want to write my
notes offline and I don't need an AI chatbot assistant. 

Obsidian is the perfect choice since it is simple, it uses markdown,
your file are stored locally, no need to create an account and also
it is completely free.

**Structure of the Void**
The idea is to structure each note like an article. When I work on some projects or study, I usually search online for additional material. When you search for technical stuff, there are many articles that provide really good explanation.
